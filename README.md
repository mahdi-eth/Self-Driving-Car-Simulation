# Self-Driving Car Simulation

A browser-based simulation training autonomous cars using a genetic algorithm. Cars equipped with neural networks learn to drive through generations of evolution. Sensors provide environmental data for decision-making. Train cars to navigate and complete driving tasks. Reinforcement learning and evolutionary computation combined in an interactive simulation.
## Features

- Genetic algorithm for evolving car driving behavior
- Neural networks as car "brains" to control driving
- Simulation of car-environment interaction
- Evaluation metrics for measuring driving performance
- Visualization of the neural network
- Manual saving and discarding of the best performing car's brain
